# Composer Github Action

This Github action allows you to run
[Composer 2](https://getcomposer.org/) install in your Github workflows.
Note that Git tags must start with a "v" prefix, for example
"v1.23.4-5".

## Example workflow

````yaml
name: Build and release Docker images
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - '**'
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Install Composer dependencies
        uses: flownative/action-composer2@master
        with:
          tag_ref: ${{ github.ref }}
â€“
````

The actual command executed by this action looks like this:

```
composer \ 
  --no-dev \
  --no-progress \
  --optimize-autoloader \
  --ignore-platform-reqs \ 
  --verbose \ 
  install
```
